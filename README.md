## LA Blueprint Developer Onboarding Project 2023
Created by: James, Siddharth

This project is built on React Native Expo intended to teach new developers and returning developers important skills in order to prepare them for their project teams.
### Goals for beginners:
This is meant to introduce you to basic React. You will consider ways to build out new features from their screens to their components. Additionally, you'll also be working on some essential frontend problems that you might face when developing for a project team.

### Setup:
1)
Clone the repo to your local setup to build off your starter code. You should be able to then remove the remote git connection and create your own repo to save your progress.
```
git clone https://github.com/lablueprint/dev-onboarding-2023.git
```

2)
Once you have setup your new repo, run start.sh to install the necessary modules and run the application. Make sure that you are in the main repo directory in your terminal and type the following command:
```
./start.sh
```

Make sure you have the Expo Go app downloaded on your mobile device. You can also use an emulator on your laptop if you prefer. Once it is on your mobile device, open up your camera (IOS) or the app camera (Android) and scan the QR code to see the application build.
